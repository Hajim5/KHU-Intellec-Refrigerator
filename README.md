# SmartFridge: Intelligent Recipe Recommendation System

## Overview
The SmartFridge project uses YOLOv5 and a custom dataset to detect items in a fridge and recommend recipes based on the detected ingredients. This system integrates object detection, recipe matching, and a user-friendly interface to enhance the cooking experience.

---

## Features
- **Food Item Detection:** High-accuracy detection of food items inside the fridge using YOLOv5 and a custom dataset.
- **Recipe Recommendation:** Suggests recipes based on available ingredients.
- **Dynamic Database Integration:** JSON-based recipe database for easy expansion.
- **Custom Training:** Training the YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset using Google Colab.
- **Roboflow Integration:** Efficient dataset annotation and management via the Roboflow API.
